# Hypotheses

We wish to test hypotheses relating to how routine activities of school
students influence crime in surrounding areas. Specifically, if school students'
activities cause increases in crime, we would expect:

  * H1: high schools to be associated with more crime on school weekdays but not 
    on vacation weekdays,
  * H2: high schools to be associated with more crime during the daytime but not 
    at night,
  * H3: high schools to be associated with more crime on streets and against 
    some types of business but not more crimes in dwellings,


# Read data

The data are already in the required format because data cleaning has been done,
so they can just be read directly from the CSV file.

```{r}
data <- read_csv("../analysis_data/blockgroup_data.csv.gz", col_types = cols(
	.default = col_double(),
	geoid = col_character(),
  state = col_integer(),
  county = col_character(),
  census_tract = col_character(),
  census_block_group = col_integer(),
  city_name = col_character(),
  count = col_integer(),
	crime_type = col_factor(levels = NULL), # levels = NULL gets levels from data
	school_day = col_logical(),
	school_time = col_logical(),
	public_location = col_character(),
  school_count = col_integer(),
  school_students = col_integer(),
	school = col_logical(),
	pop_total = col_integer(),
  density_class = col_factor(levels = NULL)
)) %>% 
	mutate_at(vars(starts_with("land_cover_prop_")), ~ifelse(. > 1, 1, .))
```


# Check data

We can check in detail that the data meets our expectations. This is done in 
this file rather than the data cleaning file in case any problems have been
introduced while saving and loading the data as a CSV.

```



# Filter data

Since our focus is on the association between school location and neighbourhood
crime, we are primarily interested in residential areas. Also studying 
industrial zones, etc would substantially increase the variables that needed to
be controlled in the model. For this reason, we will exclude any blockgroup with
a population of zero. In particular, this removes LAX, O'Hare and Rikers Island,
which could otherwise be problematic.

```{r}
data <- data %>% filter(pop_total > 0)
```



# Select a model type

Since the dependent variable is a count of crimes, we expect the data to have an
overdispersed Poisson (i.e. negative binomial) distribution. This can be checked
visually and by calculating the ratio of the variance of the dependent variable
to the mean.

```{r}
ggplot(data) + geom_histogram(aes(count), bins = 100) + theme_minimal()
```

The histograms suggest a Poisson-distributed response variable. We can check
the var/mean ratio to see if it is over-dispersed.

```{r}
var(data$count) / mean(data$count)
```

We can see the variance is much greater than the mean, so (as expected) the 
response variable is overdispersed. Thus a NB model approach looks reasonable, 
subject to tests of the resulting models.


# Transform variables

Transforming variables can help to ease interpretation, particularly of the
intercept term. `glmer.nb()` also struggles to converge when some variables are
on very different scales to others.

To deal with this, we will scale and centre some predictors. Variables with a
`_sc` suffix have been mean-centred and scaled using `scale()`.

```{r}
data <- data %>% 
	mutate(
		pop_total_sc = as.numeric(scale(pop_total, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE))
	)
```

By default, R uses the alphabetically first level of a factor as the reference
level in models. This is not always what we want, so we can use `fct_relevel()`
from `forcats` to move the preferred reference level to the front. Since the
necessary variables are currently character vectors, this will also convert them
to factors.

```{r}
# data <- data %>%
# 	mutate(
# 		city_name = fct_relevel(city_name, "New York")
# 	)
```


# Descriptive analysis

## Schools

```{r}
data %>% 
	group_by(city_name, school) %>% 
	summarise(n = n()) %>% 
	spread(school, n) %>% 
	mutate(prop_with_schools = round(`TRUE` / (`TRUE` + `FALSE`), digits = 3))
```


# Test assumptions

In the models we control for disadvantage, population turnover, ethnic 
heterogeneity and the proportion of the population who are teenagers. To see if 
this is necessary, we can test whether places with schools are different in 
these respects to places without schools.

```{r}
map_df(
	c("index_disadvantage", "index_mobility", "index_ethnic", "perc_teen_sc", 
		"prop_developed"), 
	function (x) {
		wilcox.test(as.formula(paste(x, "~ school")), data = data) %>% 
			tidy() %>% 
			mutate(test = paste("Wilcoxcon: ", x, "~ school"))
	}) %>%
	select(test, statistic, p.value, alternative) %>% 
	mutate(p.value = round(p.value, digits = 3))
```

For all but the index of disadvantage, these variables are associated with the
response variable. For this reason we will include them in the model for now.


# Build models

We will store all the models in a single list containing a list for each type of
crime. We can also initiate a list for formulae.

```{r}
f <- list()

m <- list(
	"aslt" = list(),
	"robb" = list()
)
```

## Create data for testing H1 and H2

We can test H1 and H2 together, because data to test them are available in all
cities. The data for this model require collapsing of rows so that there are not
separate rows for offenses in public/private places.

```{r}
data_h1 <- data %>% 
	group_by(geoid, crime_type, school_day, school_time) %>% 
	summarise(
		count = sum(count),
		count_lag = sum(count_lag),
		city_name = first(city_name),
		school = first(school),
		school_count = first(school_count),
		school_students = first(school_students),
		pop_total = first(pop_total),
		pop_total_sc = first(pop_total_sc),
		index_disadvantage = first(index_disadvantage),
		index_mobility = first(index_mobility),
		index_ethnic = first(index_ethnic),
		perc_teen_sc = first(perc_teen_sc),
		prop_developed = first(prop_developed)
	) %>% 
	# we must ungroup() before mutate() otherwise dplyr will mutate by group
	ungroup() %>% 
	# the count_lag variable must be scaled or the model is unlikely to converge,
	# but this must be done after count_lag is summed
	mutate(
		count_lag_sc = as.numeric(scale(count_lag, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))
	) %>% 
	glimpse()
```

## Reference models

We first create reference models for comparison later on. These models contain
only the variables necessary to describe the structure of the data, plus 
city_name.

```{r}
m$aslt$ref <- glmer(count ~ school_day + school_time + count_lag_sc + (1 | city_name), 
										subset(data_h1, crime_type == "assault"), family = "poisson")
m$robb$ref <- glmer.nb(count ~ school_day + school_time + count_lag_sc | city_name, 
											 subset(data_h1, crime_type == "robbery"))
```

## Testing H1 and H2

Eventual formula should be something like

```{r}
f$h1 <- count ~ pop_total_sc + index_disadvantage + index_mobility + 
	index_ethnic + perc_teen_sc + count_lag_sc + 
	# school*school_day*school_time
	# (1 | city_name)
	(school * school_day * school_time | city_name)
m$aslt$h1_onelevel <- glm.nb(
	f$h1, 
	data = sample_frac(subset(data_h1, crime_type == "assault"), 0.1)
)
m$aslt$h1 <- glmer.nb(
	f$h1, 
	data = subset(data_h1, crime_type == "assault"),
	control = glmerControl(calc.derivs = FALSE, optCtrl = list(maxfun = 10^7))
)

```








# Build models

We will also create some empty models for comparison later on.

```{r}
m$aslt$empty <- glm.nb(crimes_assault ~ 1, data)
m$robb$empty <- glm.nb(crimes_robbery ~ 1, data)
```


# US-wide models

The first set of models will not take into account which city each blockgroup is
in, giving us an idea of the relationship between schools and different types of
crime across the US as a whole.

## School models

The first models will only incorporate the neighbourhood-character variables, so
that the effect of including schools as a variable can be identified separately.
This also includes the lag of crime, since we can expect the crime counts to be
spatial autocorrelated.

We will use `update()` whenever possible, so that changes to one model are
reflected in subsequent models and to prevent potentially error-causing repeat
keying of variable names.

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
m$aslt$nbhd <- update(m$aslt$empty, . ~ pop_total_sc + index_disadvantage + 
												index_mobility + index_ethnic + perc_teen_sc +
												prop_developed + crimes_assault_lag, data)
m$robb$nbhd <- update(m$robb$empty, . ~ pop_total_sc + index_disadvantage + 
												index_mobility + index_ethnic + perc_teen_sc +
												prop_developed + crimes_robbery_lag, data)

# compare these models to the empty models
lapply(m, function (x) anova_compact(x))
```

From this we can see that the neighbourhood variables explain some of the 
variance in both types of crime. We could also use `anova(model)` to check
that each variable contributes to a reduction in deviance (which they do).

Now we can add whether or not there is a middle or high school in a blockgroup.

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
m$aslt$nbhd_sch <- update(m$aslt$nbhd, . ~ . + school)
m$robb$nbhd_sch <- update(m$robb$nbhd, . ~ . + school)

# compare these models to the empty models
lapply(m, function (x) anova_compact(x))
```

For both types of crime, adding the number of schools in a blockgroup to the
model decreases the deviance.

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
lapply(names(m), function (x) report_nbreg(m[[x]]$nbhd_sch, title = x))
```


## Student-number models



## Term vs vacation models

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
m$aslt$nbhd_sch_term <- update(m$aslt$nbhd_sch, crimes_assault_term ~ . 
															 - crimes_assault_lag + crimes_assault_term_lag)
m$aslt$nbhd_sch_hldy <- update(m$aslt$nbhd_sch, crimes_assault_hldy ~ .
															 - crimes_assault_lag + crimes_assault_hldy_lag)
m$robb$nbhd_sch_term <- update(m$robb$nbhd_sch, crimes_robbery_term ~ .
															 - crimes_robbery_lag + crimes_robbery_term_lag)
m$robb$nbhd_sch_hldy <- update(m$robb$nbhd_sch, crimes_robbery_hldy ~ .
															 - crimes_robbery_lag + crimes_robbery_hldy_lag)

report_nbreg(m$aslt$nbhd_sch_term, title = "Assaults, term time")
report_nbreg(m$aslt$nbhd_sch_hldy, title = "Assaults, vacation")
compare_coef(m$aslt$nbhd_sch_term, m$aslt$nbhd_sch_hldy, 
						 title = "Assaults, term time vs vacation")
report_nbreg(m$robb$nbhd_sch_term, title = "Robberies, term time")
report_nbreg(m$robb$nbhd_sch_hldy, title = "Robberies, vacation")
compare_coef(m$robb$nbhd_sch_term, m$robb$nbhd_sch_hldy,
						 title = "Robberies, term time vs vacation")
```

## School time vs non-school time

These models compare crimes between 08:00 and 16:59 with crimes at other times,
*on school days*.

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
m$aslt$nbhd_sch_timet <- update(m$aslt$nbhd_sch, crimes_assault_timet ~ . 
																- crimes_assault_lag + crimes_assault_timet_lag)
m$aslt$nbhd_sch_timef <- update(m$aslt$nbhd_sch, crimes_assault_timef ~ . 
																- crimes_assault_lag + crimes_assault_timef_lag)
m$robb$nbhd_sch_timet <- update(m$robb$nbhd_sch, crimes_robbery_timet ~ . 
																- crimes_robbery_lag + crimes_robbery_timet_lag)
m$robb$nbhd_sch_timef <- update(m$robb$nbhd_sch, crimes_robbery_timef ~ . 
																- crimes_robbery_lag + crimes_robbery_timef_lag)

report_nbreg(m$aslt$nbhd_sch_timet, title = "Assaults, school hours")
report_nbreg(m$aslt$nbhd_sch_timef, title = "Assaults, non-school hours")
compare_coef(m$aslt$nbhd_sch_timet, m$aslt$nbhd_sch_timef, 
						 title = "Assaults, school vs non-school hours")
report_nbreg(m$robb$nbhd_sch_timet, title = "Robberies, school hours")
report_nbreg(m$robb$nbhd_sch_timef, title = "Robberies, non-school hours")
compare_coef(m$robb$nbhd_sch_timet, m$robb$nbhd_sch_timef, 
						 title = "Robberies, school vs non-school hours")
```



# City-specific models

These models include a term for the city each block group is in, and an 
interaction term to allow the co-efficient for `school_count` to vary across
cities.

## School models

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
m$aslt$nbhd_sch_city <- update(m$aslt$nbhd_sch, . ~ . + city_name +
															 	school_count * city_name)

report_nbreg(m$aslt$nbhd_sch_city, title = "Assaults by city")

lapply(levels(data$city_name), function (x) {
	update(m$aslt$nbhd_sch, data = filter(data, city_name == x)) %>% 
		tidy() %>% 
		mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 3)
})
```
